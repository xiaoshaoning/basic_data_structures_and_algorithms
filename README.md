basic data structures and algorithms
====================================

A depth-first search C program WITHOUT recursion is included.

Compile:
```
g++ depth_first_search.cpp -o depth_first_search
```

Execute:
```
./depth_first_search
```
The code is a modification on an example at [Depth First Traversal or DFS for a Graph](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/)
